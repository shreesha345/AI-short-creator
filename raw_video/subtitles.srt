If you want to become better leader in India and understand all the leaders of today

00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,320
then subscribe to this channel Rajshmani Clips.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,500
So, I tell you,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,570
what is the typical media business?

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,580
And what was wrong?

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,580
In this case, I open this opportunity here,

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,100
I do it in 42.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,720
I think it was wrong.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,660
So,

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,000
traditionally media before the digital age was print and TV,

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:27,660
fundamentally.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,820
And print and TV,

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,780
both the setups and the distribution and the distribution cost is very high.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,780
And it's not every day you can set up a TV station or a newspaper or a magazine.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,920
The way to reach there is not easy.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,260
The digital fundamentally solved this problem for everyone.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:45,900
Right?

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,980
Where they said, now it's easy.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,320
The distribution is easy.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,300
Right? So, I think when we started,

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,120
it was not that something was wrong.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,100
I think it did not exist.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,240
Right?

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,870
So, in 2014-15,

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
one thing we knew,

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,820
we have started a ecosystem.

26
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,100
What tech broadly is going to be the future?

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,700
Everyone knows that now.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,340
But we could see it in 14-15 because you study US cycles and all of that.

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,400
And you can see it here.

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,900
India may be thought,

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,180
there was a huge gap.

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,840
So,

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,000
I am a doctor.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,380
What should I do?

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,500
What should I do?

36
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:34,820
I am a doctor.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,080
It almost sounds like when we used to read,

38
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,500
sorry, I am a man,

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,040
a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man,

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,520
a man, a man,

41
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,960
a man,

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,620
a man,

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,340
a man, a man.

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,080
So, because you know, what is possible?

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,920
But I think the whole startup ecosystem,

46
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,380
the concept was everything is possible.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,520
Can you bridge it with the larger audience in their language by solving the terms,

48
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,040
by breaking down everything?

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
That was a fundamental of why we started.

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,300
Okay.

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
And then we realized information,

52
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,320
it's a way of packaging and presenting,

53
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,940
which matters more than the information.

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,180
Which is better designed and the whole packaging.

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,120
So, packaging comes into the play.

56
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,580
So, I think for us design and packaging has been one of the key drivers of our growth.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
So, copy and design.

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Copy and design.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,340
And how again, how we package part of the copy and design.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
So, that has been one key factor.

61
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,400
And for us, I think we were very early movers.

62
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
I wouldn't call first movers.

63
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,920
There were a couple of companies who were doing it.

64
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
We were very early movers.

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,700
Our design, copy packaging was up to the mark which India usually has not seen.

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,080
I had a fits time.

67
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,600
And we had a huge belief that the content we are doing is going to become one of the key pillars.

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,980
Of the country in next time into 10 years,

69
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,180
which it has become now,

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,680
where startup today is part of startup 20.

71
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,900
Like a G20 with S20 now.

72
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,240
There's a prime minister talking about the startup ecosystem.

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,300
Right. With this lot of data which is needed around it,

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,360
we are raised more than 140 billion dollar as a country in startups.

75
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,680
More than 90,000 startups.

76
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,300
140 billion dollar raised 110 plus unicorns.

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,440
Right.

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,500
And again, unicorn may be a backtum or a good term right now.

79
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,680
But it is the index of.

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah.

81
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,720
Growth or health of the country in this context.

82
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,420
Right. A certain level of success.

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,480
We know and thought this in 2014 or 2015.

84
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,080
Right.

85
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,160
And under confident country suddenly gets a lot of confidence that yes,

86
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,080
we can also do it.

87
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:33,860
Right.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,700
Yes, we have a talent.

89
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,100
We have the means and it is not as hard as we thought it will be.

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,320
And you know, the whole every model you see now is coming from those areas.

91
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,100
But people are just getting up and saying,

92
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,880
we will make it.

93
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,520
And we are right.

94
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,300
Right.

95
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,420
Today's space tech.

96
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,920
You see.

97
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,120
Of course, great success.

98
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,960
But there are too many startups right who are building rockets.

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,220
So I made a rocket.

100
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
I thought, you are making a rocket.

101
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,740
You made a rocket.

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
Well, that's not easy.

103
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,600
Yeah. You think that you have to make a rocket.

104
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,080
I mean, content money is fine.

105
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,900
Rocket money.

106
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,060
Well, such amazing talent.

107
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,340
Yeah.

108
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,700
Yeah.

109
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:06,920
Yeah.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
But no one no one brought this talent together and said,

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,700
you can do it.

112
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,180
We will pay.

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
No one funded this.

114
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,420
No one funded that.

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,620
Right.

116
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,440
And it was even not possible to go out and raise money.

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,860
The opportunity did not exist right.

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,760
So for us,

119
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,340
the third process was,

120
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,180
the year in the last 10 years,

121
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,800
India will reach here.

122
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,800
World will reach here.

123
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,720
Can we play a role in the success of the overall country when it comes to the startup ecosystem?

124
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,260
Larger third process.

125
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,560
And then we keep kept on evolving,

126
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,920
evolving, evolving over the years.

127
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,000
And then we said,

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,580
here, if we are helping founders and investors and the operators to create impact,

129
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,120
we eventually become a big catalyst of overall impact.

130
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,140
Now, this is what I was told to do.

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,340
We have to forward this success.

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,180
This is all right.

133
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,980
We have to process how stories are made.

134
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,660
How to get from the market.

135
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,100
How do we know how to do it?

136
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,920
How do we verify it?

137
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,800
What is the process?

138
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,520
I don't know.

139
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,200
Just tell me.

140
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,140
I think, and again, I can generally say for any media company.

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,180
I tell you, I want to cut down and tell you something.

142
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,740
When I want to make some content related to startup,

143
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,840
then I go to the

144
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,260
YouTube,

145
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,120
I will go to the Forbes, the Money Control,

146
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,880
the InSubs, and I will read them.

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
And then I will make it.

148
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,020
Where do you guys get it from?

149
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,000
All the content great is very media.

150
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,460
And we learn from there.

151
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,640
So here's what I solved.

152
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,980
And this is what I'm solving through

153
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,760
figuring out as well.

154
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,760
It's like the same conversation that brother is coming.

155
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,340
Flipkart is a billion dollars.

156
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,300
So what do I do?

157
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
So what do I do?

158
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,500
What I'm solving is that if we cut this flip,

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
then this will make this opportunity.

160
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,040
This opportunity can be taken like this.

161
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,000
This is what happens.

162
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,740
So I'm just opening it.

163
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,720
How do I convert it into an opportunity and explain it to people?

164
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,960
But my sources are you guys.

165
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,960
How do you get sources?

166
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,340
I think multiple sources are.

167
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,880
I think, like for us,

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,580
a lot of companies will reach out to us directly and say,

169
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,100
this is what they do.

170
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,760
Sometimes you ask them to show data or proof.

171
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,260
Sometimes you don't, depending on the nature of the content.

172
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,560
And credibility,

173
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,900
right? Now for your hypothetical,

174
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,780
you can quote a unique founder and say something.

175
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,200
And if he is wrong,

176
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,460
then you will come to the founder.

177
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,360
Right?

178
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,220
And then you also build this gut over the years.

179
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,720
Right?

180
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,300
Other journalists.

181
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,220
And it's not me.

182
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,380
Right?

183
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm not even a journalist.

184
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
The folks who work,

185
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,360
the actual journalists who actually produce this content,

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,040
they do the hard work.

187
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,980
Right? So they build the gut.

188
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,620
Right?

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,580
Pooja, I co-found her.

190
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,400
She is editor in chief.

191
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,920
She would have.

192
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,900
She has a lot of gut.

193
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,240
And I see this every day.

194
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,320
And I ask her, how?

195
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,680
And she said, no, I said, no, I said, no, I don't want to prove it.

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,860
She said, look how it's going to look.

197
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,700
And like two days down,

198
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,560
three days down the line,

199
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,700
we'll, I will hear the same news.

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,120
Right? So you just get the nag on doing things.

201
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,040
Right? Look, people can't tell you.

202
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,540
They're not right.

203
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,780
I wish.

204
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,380
I wish.

205
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,520
So that's why we're in a physiological business side.

206
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,660
But I think after reading the content or the,

207
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,740
or consuming the information,

208
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,200
you can start making sense.

209
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,460
Right?

210
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,800
You do figuring out you,

211
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,180
you see a lot of podcasts.

212
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,500
And you think, you need me, you can ask a number of podcasts.

213
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,920
You'll just launch a video and then you'll get 5 million views in one hour.

214
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,400
You'll say, you'll get the phone.

215
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,660
Or you'll say, you'll get the phone.

216
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,620
What's going on?

217
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,740
It's just like the same thing.

218
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,960
Right? You build that gut.

219
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,720
Gutt plays a very important role for any journalist.

220
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,460
Because you cannot ask proof of everything.

221
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,360
Right?

222
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,540
So one is companies coming to us.

223
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,340
Second is credible sources like founders,

224
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,980
investors coming on record.

225
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,540
Then a lot of these people come off record.

226
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,600
They would share a lot of information with us off the record.

227
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,020
Anonymous.

228
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Anonymous.

229
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,280
Malavino.

230
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,540
But they would share off the record for various reasons.

231
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,860
They don't want their name, etc.

232
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,120
etc. Why did they do that?

233
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,000
Again, they might have their own vested reasons.

234
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,400
They might want to do general good.

235
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,080
Multiple reasons.

236
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,580
Then it's a journalist call to see.

237
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,180
He has a reason.

238
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,120
What's going to happen to me?

239
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,760
And based on,

240
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,180
you know, if it fits the bill,

241
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,680
you go ahead or not go ahead.

242
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,960
If you see every media and specially political is branded.

243
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,300
Yeah, it is gang couple.

244
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,260
Every media belongs to a gang.

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,260
But then media doesn't know.

246
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,300
Everyone else knows.

247
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,100
If people say that you are a gang partner.

248
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,440
I never said that in gang meetings.

249
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,120
I mean, if there is a meeting meeting,

250
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,220
then what will happen?

251
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,180
Which party will you be in?

252
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,860
I mean, I have given money to come to a gang.

253
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,280
People have very interesting perceptions.

254
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,000
And these perceptions become Chinese vispers.

255
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,920
And then Chinese vispers become reality.

256
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:43,940
Right?

257
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,780
But actually,

258
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,240
there is nothing.

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,700
So, when you come to sources again,

260
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
people tell companies tell off the record on the record.

261
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,000
Then we get to know from network a lot.

262
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
You build this network over five years,

263
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,520
ten years.

264
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,720
People tell you a lot of things.

265
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,760
Then a lot of employees in the company,

266
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,460
when they are getting fired.

267
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
Or something goes wrong.

268
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,360
They want to come on record.

269
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,140
They want to come off record and tell you.

270
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,300
So you eventually build a network and get plays a very important role.

271
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,640
And then comes to your thoughts.

272
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,540
Your brand thoughts, your internal thoughts as an individual as a journalist.

273
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,860
What you will write,

274
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,340
what you will not write.

275
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
